Creating and sustaining businesses is a very intensive process that requires
educating and spreading values and deciding the allocation of natural resources.
Businesses of all kinds have an ecological impact that we tend to forget about,
particularly as so many things move to the cloud and people work from home.

A responsible business leader is aware of the impact their company has on the
planet, in the lives of its employees and the community where it operates.

There are some who micro-manage the prisons of the mind, it takes a lot of work
and effort to subjugate people to live in unnatural ways. Freedom, joy, and
abundance are the ways of nature.

Those who share those values must find each other, learn, and collaborate to
reach positions of power and influence to use our budgets adequately, to
influence legislation and better business practices for the wellness of our
communities and the planet.
