As a young activist in Colombia, I participated in the peace process with FARC-EP and visited the [DMZ](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zona_de_distensi%C3%B3n) in 2001.

One of my presentations was titled "peace is the way", alluding to the saying by Ghandi and the book by Deepak Chopra.
After two deecades as an organizer and consultant I've develop a comprenhensive approach that yields faster and more impactful results.

Traditional hierarchies often can't keep up with the pace of innovation, peaceful organizers tend to reinforce the status quo. At Club Calima, we embrace the chaotic vibrance from our Colombian nature.
