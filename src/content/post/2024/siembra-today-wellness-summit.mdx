We're beyond excited to kick off the evening with Erica Priscilla Sandoval, LCSW, Executive Director of Siembra Today.
Erica’s going to dive deep into why Siembra exists,  goals, and, most importantly, how YOU can be part of this movement for lasting, positive change.

She’ll also introduce their amazing team, the heart and soul, and set the tone for the night. Together, we’re creating a space for growth, connection, and healing. This evening is all about nourishing ourselves and each other.

We’ll start with an incredible herbal infusion demo led by the wonderful Carolina Bolivar. Carolina will guide us through a transformative session on the healing power of plants using herbal tea. You’ll sip on warm, soothing infusions, while tuning into your inner self and learning how to use the wisdom of plants to nurture your emotional and spiritual well-being. It’s all about grounding, setting intentions, and manifesting positive change in your life.

Then, we’ll move into a deeply relaxing Yoga Nidra and Sound Healing session with Andrea Bertucci and Sandra Castillo. Through a gentle body scan meditation and the calming sounds of singing bowls, you’ll find peace within, release tension, and invite in pure tranquility. Yoga Nidra will guide you into a state of rest and refresh your spirit in ways you didn’t even know you needed.

Afterward, stick around for our conscious networking session, where you’ll have the chance to connect with special guests from VECINOS and Club Calima. With light refreshments, we’ll dive into conversations about wellness, building community, and finding new ways to collaborate.

This event is your opportunity to relax, recharge, and connect with like-minded people who care about wellness, growth, and positive change. Come join us and leave feeling more connected to yourself, nature, and our incredible community.

Huge thanks to the Hispanic Federation UPLift NY grant for making this possible, and a special shout-out to DigitalOcean for their generous support!
