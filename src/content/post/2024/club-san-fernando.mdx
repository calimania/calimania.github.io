Welcome to Club Campestre San Fernando, a serene oasis nestled in the heart of upstate New York.

Our vision for this unique country club is to create a haven where leadership, creativity, and conservation come together in perfect harmony. As we prepare for our grand opening to the public next year, we are thrilled to share our journey and invite you to be part of this exciting venture.

## A Sanctuary for Leadership and Creativity

At Club Campestre San Fernando, we believe in the power of community and the importance of fostering growth and innovation. Our country club is designed to host a variety of enriching activities, including:

- **Leadership Retreats:** We offer bespoke programs that cater to corporate teams, non-profit organizations, and individuals seeking personal development. Our retreats are designed to inspire, challenge, and rejuvenate, set against the backdrop of our beautiful natural surroundings.
- **Artist Residencies:** Creativity thrives in tranquil settings. We provide a supportive environment for artists to immerse themselves in their work, exchange ideas, and collaborate on projects. From painters to writers to musicians, we welcome artists from all disciplines to find inspiration at Club Campestre San Fernando.
- **Conservation Projects:** Our commitment to the environment is at the core of our mission. We are actively involved in conservation efforts to preserve the natural beauty of our landscape. Our projects include habitat restoration, wildlife protection, and sustainable land management practices.

## Building for the Future

We are continuously working to enhance our facilities to provide the best possible experience for our members and guests. With plans to finance and add state-of-the-art amenities, we aim to create a space that caters to a diverse range of interests and activities.

Our future facilities will include:

- **Modern Accommodations:** Comfortable and stylish lodging options to ensure a restful stay.
- **Event Spaces:** Versatile venues for hosting events, workshops, and gatherings.
- **Recreational Areas:** Facilities for sports, fitness, and outdoor activities to promote well-being and relaxation.
