We are thrilled to introduce **Markketplace**, an innovative open source marketplace tool built on top of Strapi. Designed to empower both communities and individuals, Markketplace offers a versatile platform for launching and managing online stores, either independently or within a broader community.

### What is Markketplace?

- **Enable Community Marketplaces**: Communities can create their own marketplaces, supporting local artisans, collectives, and groups like Morir Soniando.

### Key Features
