As we look ahead to 2060, the landscape of the United States is set to change dramatically. Data indicates that the Latinx population is one of the fastest-growing demographic groups, with Spanish-speaking business leaders becoming increasingly influential. This growth presents both an opportunity and a responsibility for those of us in leadership roles to shape the future in a way that benefits our communities and businesses.

## The Growing Influence of Latinx and Spanish-Speaking Leaders

By 2060, projections show that Latinx individuals will make up a significant portion of the U.S. population. As this demographic expands, so too will the number of Spanish-speaking business leaders and entrepreneurs.

At Calima, we believe it is our duty to harness this momentum and ensure that the growth of our communities translates into sustainable success and equitable opportunities for all.

## Responsible Leadership: Advocating for Policies that Matter

As business leaders, we have a responsibility to support candidates and policies that benefit our communities. This includes advocating for legislation that promotes fair labor practices, equitable access to resources, and opportunities for all members of our society.

By actively engaging in the political process, we can help shape policies that foster economic growth while also protecting the rights and well-being of workers.

Supporting policies that benefit our communities is not just a moral imperative; it's also good business. A healthy, thriving community leads to a robust economy, which in turn creates more opportunities for businesses to grow and succeed.

## Creating Fair and Equitable Workplaces

We encourage our members and partner companies to prioritize good labor conditions. This means offering fair wages, promoting work-life balance, and ensuring that all employees are treated with respect and dignity. By doing so, we can create a business ecosystem that is not only resilient but also aligned with our long-term goals of equity and sustainability.

Moreover, fostering fair deals and transparent business practices strengthens trust within our communities and builds a reputation for integrity and reliability. These are the foundations upon which lasting business relationships are built.

## Promoting Civic Engagement for a Stronger Business Environment

Civic engagement is another crucial component of our 2060 strategy. Encouraging our members to participate in civic activities, whether by voting, volunteering, or advocating for important causes, helps create a more engaged and informed community. This, in turn, leads to better decision-making at both the local and national levels, benefiting businesses and communities alike.

By fostering a culture of civic responsibility, we can help ensure that the voices of our communities are heard and that our collective interests are represented in the halls of power.

## Looking Ahead: A Vision for 2060

As we work towards our 2060 strategy, we envision a future where our communities are at the forefront of innovation, leadership, and economic success.

## Open Source & Interoperability

A critical aspect of our approach is leveraging open-source technologies and ensuring interoperability. These technical decisions are not merely about adopting the latest trends but are deeply intertwined with political and social implications. We want to foster transparency and collaboration, while and ensure that different systems and technologies can work together seamlessly.

> Interoperability is key to improving patient care and access.
