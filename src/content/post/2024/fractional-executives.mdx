Club Calima members are business owners and leaders with access to their own
teams of professionals in multiple disciplines. With the goal of expanding our
market share and enabling more international collaboration we're offering
fractional executive services to support small businesses, non profits and early
stage startups while they fundraise, and train a team to take over to inspire a new
generation of business leaders.

## Fractional Executives

Fractional executives are seasoned professionals who offer their expertise to
companies on a part-time or project basis. This concept has been gaining
popularity as it allows startups and small businesses to benefit from high-level
executive talent without the need for a full-time commitment. A fractional
executive can serve in various roles, including CEO, CFO, CMO, or CTO, depending
on the company's needs.

At Calima, we provide a platform for startups to connect with these experienced
executives. We have a diverse team of technical, business, and branding experts
ready to help you take your startup to the next level.

While many of our talented collaborators are in Colombia, we are actively
expanding our network to include professionals from around the globe. Our
mission is to continue providing high-quality services and talent to promising
early-stage startups, no matter where they are located or their current funding.
