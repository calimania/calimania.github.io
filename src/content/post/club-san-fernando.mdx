# Club Deportivo San Fernando (1933 - 2007)

If you're going by the fifth, is my beautiful cali that you're crossing, and
there you would go by the old location of the San Fernando Sports Club.

If in the afternoons the palm trees happily move around, the night is waiting.

The Club San Fernando was an emblematic location in Cali, Colombia. It was the first of its kind in the city
and hosted important social events for decades.
[Bernando Pinzón](https://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/CMS-4791207), a caleño businessperson lost control
of the property during the economic downfall of the city.

**The end of this iconic location came with an economic crisis that devastated the city.**

Years went by while different owners would make plans that never came to be, the
property started falling apart and it was eventually demolished.

The walls took away with them echoes from the top musicians of their times. La
Billo´s Caracas Boys, Matecaña, Benny Moré, Agustín Lara o Xavier Cugat, Lucho” Bermúdez, Matilde Díaz,

In 1956, after a terrible
[tragedy in the city](https://www.banrepcultural.org/biblioteca-virtual/credencial-historia/numero-117/la-explosion-de-cali-agosto-7-de-1956)
, the halls became hospital rooms to acomodate the sudden influx of patients being treated by
members of the club who happened to be doctors.

The location is now becoming a technological center that is going to house an
observatory and multiple associations for economic and cultural development.
