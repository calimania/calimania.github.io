# Travel to el Lago Calima

Calima Lake, located in Calima El Darien, is recognized as the largest
artificial lake in Colombia and the continent, with the fastest winds in Latin
America and third in the world, which is why it is an ideal place to practice
water sports. And beyond these special characteristics, is a peaceful place
surrounded by thick nature, among some large and imposing mountains.
