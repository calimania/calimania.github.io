# Calima, Land of Gold and Shamans

The Calima people were one of the oldest civilizations among the pre-Columbian
cultures of ancient Colombia and emerged as early as 1500 BC.

They developed until around the sixth century AD in four different cultural
stages, which scholars classify as Ilama, Yotoco, Sonso, and Malagana.

Throughout the centuries, Calima people grew their economy, agricultural
expertise, and artisanship leaving behind a significant legacy reflected through
archeological artifacts and antiquities. In addition, Calima goldwork enriched
the ancient Colombian metalworking traditions, and Calima art is precious among
collectors.
