In February 29, 2024* we're inviting Colombian business leaders and officials to
join us for a 3 day event of networking and high level collaboration
opportunities to strenghten our business relationships.

We believe that there are opportunities for Latin American investors and
business associations to expand their pressence in the USA, and support their
peers here.

Decision makers from a variety of industries will are getting together to
promote innovative partnerships and unlock capital for aspiring founders with
ambitious ideas.

​The three days of programming will have a variety of workshops, panels and
opportunities to facilitate new projects and grow existing ones.

​There are multiple opportunities to participate and help us create a memorable
event that can become a yearly staple to accelerate innovation and growth in the
region.

**​Club Calima** is an executive community with members from Colombia who want
*to create stronger ties with their peers in the US and through Latin America.

**​Colombia** is the best hub for business in the region, and creating stronger
links with our peers in the US can increase business opportunities, with
 our expertise navigating the legislative and cultural barriers.
