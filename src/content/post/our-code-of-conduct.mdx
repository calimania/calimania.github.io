# Code of Conduct

You can find our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct) here.

> Un comportamiento ético implica, entre otros aspectos, respeto, honestidad, responsabilidad y empatía

Regardless of whether your organization is legally mandated to have a code of
conduct (as public companies are), every organization should have one. A code
has value as both an internal guideline and an external statement of corporate
values and commitments.

A well-written code of conduct clarifies an organization’s mission, values and
principles, linking them with standards of professional conduct. The code
articulates the values the organization wishes to foster in leaders and
employees and, in doing so, defines desired behavior. As a result, written codes
of conduct or ethics can become benchmarks against which individual and
organizational performance can be measured.

Additionally, a code is a central guide and reference for employees to support
day-to-day decision making. A code encourages discussions of ethics and
compliance, empowering employees to handle ethical dilemmas they encounter in
everyday work. It can also serve as a valuable reference, helping employees
locate relevant documents, services and other resources related to ethics within
the organization.

Externally, a code serves several important purposes:

**Compliance**: Legislation (i.e., the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) requires
individuals serving on boards and organizational leaders of public companies to
implement codes or clearly explain why they have not.

**Marketing**: A code serves
as a public statement of what the company stands for and its commitment to high
standards and right conduct.

**Risk Mitigation**: Organizations with codes of
ethics, and who follow other defined steps in the U.S. Sentencing Commission’s
Federal Sentencing Guidelines, can reduce the financial risks associated with
government fines for ethical misconduct by demonstrating they have made a “good
faith effort” to prevent illegal acts.
