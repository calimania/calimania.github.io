      Capital Region
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our home in the Capital Region of New York, a place shaped by industry,
      rivers, universities, and generations of builders and artists
      <br>
      <br>
      Between the waterfalls and historic mills of Cohoes and the walkable,
      artsy streets of Troy, the region share our values
      about: craft, resilience, collaboration, and community
      <br>
      <br>

    </p>
    <p>
      <strong class="text-magenta">Why the Capital Region?</strong>
      <br>
      Upstate New York offers a rare combination of advantages:

      <li class="py-4">Access to nature, trails, rivers, and four true seasons</li>
      <li class="py-4">Proximity to New York City</li>
      <li class="py-4">Deep academic, artistic, and technical roots</li>
      <li class="py-4">Independent maker spaces and fabrication shops</li>
      <li class="py-4">Film and media scene</li>
